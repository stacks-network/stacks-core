# Security Policy

Please visit [https://stacks.org/security](https://stacks.org/security) for the most up-to-date information on our security policy.

## Supported Versions

Please see [Releases](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-core/releases).

Generally, we only support the functionality of [the most recent release](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-core/releases/latest). This is because releases sometimes contain features activated by a "hard-fork" epoch block which significantly change network and node functionality (see: [SIPs](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips)).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT file a public issue or PR mentioning the vulnerability.**

The Stacks Foundation has partnered with [ImmuneFi](https://immunefi.com/) to reward honest researchers who find and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in our critical code. Bounties are payable in the Stacks token ([STX](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stacks)) for accepted, high-quality submissions.
