 *  2. This "commit" transaction is called _before_ the PoX anchor block.
 *
 * This command calls `stack-aggregation-commit` using a `signature`.
 *
 * Constraints for running this command include:
 * - The Operator must have locked STX on behalf of at least one stacker.
 * - The total amount previously locked by the Operator on behalf of the
 *   stackers has to be greater than the uSTX threshold.
