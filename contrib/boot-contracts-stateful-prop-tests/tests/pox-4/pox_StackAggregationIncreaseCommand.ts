/**

 * partially stacked STX to a PoX address which has already received
 * some STX (more than the `stacking minimum`).
 * This allows a delegator to lock up marginally more STX from new
 * delegates, even if they collectively do not exceed the Stacking
 * minimum, so long as the target PoX address already represents at
 * least as many STX as the `stacking minimum`.
 * This command calls stack-aggregation-increase.
 *
 * Constraints for running this command include:
 * - The Operator must have locked STX on behalf of at least one stacker.
 * - The PoX address must have partial committed STX.
 * - The Reward Cycle Index must be positive.
