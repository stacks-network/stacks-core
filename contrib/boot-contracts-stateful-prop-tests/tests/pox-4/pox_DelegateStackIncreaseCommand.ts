 *
 * Constraints for running this command include:
 * - The Stacker must have locked uSTX.
 * - The Operator has to currently be delegated by the Stacker.
 * - The increase amount must be greater than 0.
 * - Stacker's unlocked uSTX amount must be greater than or equal
 *   to the value of the increase amount.
 * - Stacker's maximum delegated amount must be greater than or equal
 *   to the final locked amount.
 * - The Operator must have locked the Stacker's previously locked funds.
