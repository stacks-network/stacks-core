# RPC Endpoints

### POST /v2/transactions

This endpoint is for posting _raw_ transaction data to the node's mempool.

Rejections result in a 400 error, with JSON data in the form:

```json

### GET /v2/pox

Get current PoX-relevant information. See OpenAPI [spec](./rpc/openapi.yaml) for details.

### GET /v2/headers/[Count]

Get a given number of ancestral Stacks block headers, in order from newest to
oldest.  If the `?tip=` query parameter is given, the headers will be loaded
from the block identified by the tip.  If no `?tip=` query parameter is given,
then the canonical Stacks chain tip will be used.  The first header in the list
is the header of the `?tip=` query parameter (or the canonical tip of the blockchain);
the second header is the parent block's header; the third header is the
grandparent block's header, and so on. [Count] determines how many headers, including this first header, to return.

Up to 2100 headers (one PoX reward cycle) may be returned by this endpoint.
Callers who wish to download more headers will need to issue this query
multiple times, with a `?tip=` query parameter set to the index block hash of
the earliest header received.

Returns a JSON list containing the following:

```json
[
  {
    "consensus_hash": "dff37af13badf99683228e61c71585bb7a82ac92",
    "header":
"0600000047ddfbee8c00000000000222c7ad9042e5a67a703ff3b06581e3fd8a2f1496a563dc41462ebf8e5b046b43e7085f20e828840f26fefbe93a048f6c390ce55b954b188a43781fa0db61c091dbb840717fda77f9fc16d8ac85f80bbf2d04a20d17328390e03b8f496986f6351def656fd12cc4b8fe5e2cfb8d3f2e67c3a700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000fb432fbe28fb60ab37c8f59eec2397a0d0bcaf679a34b39d02d338935c7e723e062d571e331fb5016d3000ab68da691baa02b4a5dde7befa2edceb219af959312544d306919a59ee4cfd616dc3cc44a6f01ac7c8",
    "parent_block_id":
"e0cb2be07552556f856503d2fbd855a27d49dc5a8c47fb2d9f0314eb6bad6861"
  }
]
```

The `consensus_hash` field identifies the sortition in which the given block was
chosen.  The `header` is the raw block header, a hex string.  The
`parent_block_id` is the block ID hash of this block's parent, and can be used
as a `?tip=` query parameter to page through deeper and deeper block headers.

This API endpoint may return a list of zero headers if `?tip=` refers to the
hash of the Stacks genesis block.

This API endpoint will return HTTP 404 if the `?tip=` argument is given but
refers to a nonexistent Stacks block, or a Stacks block that has not yet been
processed by the node.

The `?tip=` argument may refer to a Stacks block that is not on the canonical
fork.  In this case, this endpoint behaves as described above, except that
non-canonical headers will be returned instead.

### GET /v2/accounts/[Principal]

Get the account data for the provided principal.
The principal string is either a Stacks address or a Contract identifier (e.g.,
`SP31DA6FTSJX2WGTZ69SFY11BH51NZMB0ZW97B5P0.get-info`

Returns JSON data in the form:

```json
{
 "balance": "0x100..",
 "nonce": 1,
 "balance_proof": "0x01fa...",
 "nonce_proof": "0x01ab...",
}
```

Where balance is the hex encoding of an unsigned 128-bit integer
(big-endian), nonce is an unsigned 64-bit integer, and the proofs are
provided as hex strings.

For non-existent accounts, this _does not_ 404, rather it returns an
object with balance and nonce of 0.

This endpoint also accepts a querystring parameter `?proof=` which when supplied `0`, will return the
JSON object _without_ the `balance_proof` or `nonce_proof` fields.

### GET /v2/data_var/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]/[Var Name]

Attempt to vetch a data var from a contract. The contract is identified with [Stacks Address] and
 [Contract Name] in the URL path. The variable is identified with [Var Name].

Returns JSON data in the form:

```json
{
 "data": "0x01ce...",
 "proof": "0x01ab...",
}
```

Where data is the hex serialization of the variable value.

This endpoint also accepts a querystring parameter `?proof=` which when supplied `0`, will return the
JSON object _without_ the `proof` field.

### GET /v2/clarity/marf/[Clarity MARF Key]
Attempt to fetch the value of a MARF key. The key is identified with [Clarity MARF Key].

Returns JSON data in the form:

```json
{
  "data": "0x01ce...",
  "proof": "0x01ab...",
}
```

Where data is the hex serialization of the value.

### GET /v2/clarity/metadata/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]/[Clarity Metadata Key]
Attempt to fetch the metadata of a contract.
 The contract is identified with [Stacks Address] and [Contract Name] in the URL path.
 The metadata key is identified with [Clarity Metadata Key].

Returns JSON data in the form:

```json
{
  "data": "'{\"contract_identifier\":{...}'",
}
```

Where data is the metadata formatted as a JSON string.

### GET /v2/constant_val/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]/[Constant Name]
Attempt to fetch a constant from a contract. The contract is identified with [Stacks Address] and
 [Contract Name] in the URL path. The constant is identified with [Constant Name].

Returns JSON data in the form:

```json
{
  "data": "0x01ce...",
}
```

Where data is the hex serialization of the constant value.

### POST /v2/map_entry/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]/[Map Name]

Attempt to fetch data from a contract data map. The contract is identified with [Stacks Address] and
 [Contract Name] in the URL path. The map is identified with [Map Name].

The _key_ to lookup in the map is supplied via the POST body. This should be supplied as the hex string
serialization of the key (which should be a Clarity value). Note, this is a _JSON_ string atom.

Returns JSON data in the form:

```json
{
 "data": "0x01ce...",
 "proof": "0x01ab...",
}
```

Where data is the hex serialization of the map response. Note that map responses are Clarity _option_ types,
for non-existent values, this is a serialized `none`, and for all other responses, it is a serialized `(some ...)`
object.

This endpoint also accepts a querystring parameter `?proof=` which when supplied `0`, will return the
JSON object _without_ the `proof` field.

### GET /v2/fees/transfer

Get an estimated fee rate for STX transfer transactions. This is a fee rate / byte, and is returned as a JSON integer.

### GET /v2/contracts/interface/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]

Fetch the contract interface for a given contract, identified by [Stacks Address] and [Contract Name].

This returns a JSON object of the form:

```json

}
```

### GET /v2/contracts/source/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]

Fetch the source for a smart contract, along with the block height it was
published in, and the MARF proof for the data.

```json
{
 "source": "(define-private ...",
 "publish_height": 1,
 "proof": "0x00213..."
}
```

This endpoint also accepts a querystring parameter `?proof=` which
when supplied `0`, will return the JSON object _without_ the `proof`
field.

### POST /v2/contracts/call-read/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]/[Function Name]

Call a read-only public function on a given smart contract.

The smart contract and function are specified using the URL path. The arguments and
the simulated `tx-sender` are supplied via the POST body in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "sender": "SP31DA6FTSJX2WGTZ69SFY11BH51NZMB0ZW97B5P0.get-info",
  "arguments": [ "0x0011...", "0x00231..." ]
}
```

Where sender is either a Contract identifier or a normal Stacks address, and arguments
is an array of hex serialized Clarity values.

This endpoint returns a JSON object of the following form:

```json
{
  "okay": true,
  "result": "0x0011..."
}
```

Where `"okay"` is `true` if the function executed successfully, and result contains the
hex serialization of the Clarity return value.

If an error occurs in processing the function call, this endpoint returns a 200 response with a JSON
object of the following form:

```json
{
  "okay": false,
  "cause": "Unchecked(PublicFunctionNotReadOnly(..."
}
```

### GET /v2/traits/[Stacks Address]/[Contract Name]/[Trait Stacks Address]/[Trait Contract Name]/[Trait Name]

### POST /v3/block_proposal

Used by miner to validate a proposed Stacks block using JSON encoding.

**This endpoint will only accept requests over the local loopback network interface.**

This endpoint takes as input the following struct from `chainstate/stacks/miner.rs`:

```rust
pub struct NakamotoBlockProposal {
    /// Proposed block
    pub block: NakamotoBlock,
    /// Identifies which chain block is for (Mainnet, Testnet, etc.)
    pub chain_id: u32,
}
```

#### Responses over the Event Observer Interface

This endpoint returns asynchronous results to the caller via the event observer interface.
A caller must have registered an event observer using the `block_proposal` key in the stacks-node
config file.

The result is issued via POSTing the response JSON over the `/proposal_response` endpoint on the
registered observer.

Ok response example:

```json
{
    "result": "Ok",
    "block": "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",

```

### GET /v3/blocks/[Block ID]

Fetch a Nakamoto block given its block ID hash.  This returns the raw block
data.

This will return 404 if the block does not exist.

### GET /v3/blocks/height/[Block Height]

Fetch a Nakamoto block given its block height.  This returns the raw block
data.

This will return 404 if the block does not exist.

This endpoint also accepts a querystring parameter `?tip=` which when supplied
will return the block relative to the specified tip allowing the querying of
sibling blocks (same height, different tip) too.

### GET /v3/tenures/[Block ID]

Fetch a Nakamoto block and all of its ancestors in the same tenure, given its
block ID hash.  At most `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` (i.e. 2 MB) of data will be returned.
If the tenure is larger than this, then the caller can page through the tenure
by repeatedly invoking this endpoint with the deepest block's block ID until
only a single block is returned (i.e. the tenure-start block).

This method returns one or more raw blocks, concatenated together.

This method returns 404 if there are no blocks with the given block ID.

### GET /v3/tenures/info

Return metadata about the highest-known tenure, as the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "consensus_hash": "dca60a97a135189d67a5ad6d2dac90f289b19c96",
  "reward_cycle": 5,
  "tip_block_id": "317c0ee162d1ee02c67d5bca79003dafc59aa84579360387f43650c37491ac3b",
  "tip_height": 116
}
```

Here, `consensus_hash` identifies the highest-known tenure (which may not be the
highest sortition), `reward_cycle` identifies the reward cycle number of this
tenure, `tip_block_id` identifies the highest-known block in this tenure, and
`tip_height` identifies that block's height.

### GET /v3/signer/[Signer Pubkey]/[Reward Cycle]

Get number of blocks signed by signer during a given reward cycle

Returns a non-negative integer

### GET /v3/transaction/[Transaction ID]

Returns the index_block_hash, the transaction body (as hex) and the result given the TXID.

```json
{

This feature requires enabling of transaction indexing by setting the `txindex` node option.

This will return 404 if the transaction does not exist and 501 (Not Implemented) if
transaction indexing is not enabled.


### GET /v3/health

Determine node's synchronization health, comparing the node's current Stacks tip height
with the maximum Stacks tip height observed among its connected peers.
If there are no valid initial peers or data for the node to determine this information, this endpoint returns an error. The endpoint returns the node's current Stacks tip height, the maximum Stacks tip height observed among its connected peers, and the difference between these two heights.
A user can utilize the `difference_from_max_peer` to establish their own criteria for determining if a node is out of sync.

See OpenAPI [spec](./rpc/openapi.yaml) for details.
