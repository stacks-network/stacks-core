# Stacks Improvement Proposals

Stacks improvement proposals (SIPs) are aimed at describing the implementation of the Stacks blockchain, as well as proposing improvements. They should contain concise technical specifications of features or standards and the rationale behind it. SIPs are intended to be the primary medium for proposing new features, for collecting community input on a system-wide issue, and for documenting design decisions.

See [SIP 000](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-000/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md) for more details.

The SIPs now located in the [stacksgov/sips](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips) repository as part of the [Stacks Community Governance organization](https://github.com/stacksgov).
