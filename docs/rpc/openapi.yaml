      summary: Get approximate fees for the given transaction
      tags:
        - Fees
      description: |
        Get an estimated fee for the supplied transaction.  This
        estimates the execution cost of the transaction, the current
        fee rate of the network, and returns estimates for fee
        amounts.

        * `transaction_payload` is a hex-encoded serialization of
          the TransactionPayload for the transaction.
        * `estimated_len` is an optional argument that provides the
          endpoint with an estimation of the final length (in bytes)
          of the transaction, including any post-conditions and
          signatures

        If the node cannot provide an estimate for the transaction
        (e.g., if the node has never seen a contract-call for the
        given contract and function) or if estimation is not
        configured on this node, a 400 response is returned.
        The 400 response will be a JSON error containing a `reason`
        field which can be one of the following:

        * `DatabaseError` - this Stacks node has had an internal
          database error while trying to estimate the costs of the
          supplied transaction.
        * `NoEstimateAvailable` - this Stacks node has not seen this
          kind of contract-call before, and it cannot provide an
          estimate yet.
        * `CostEstimationDisabled` - this Stacks node does not perform
          fee or cost estimation, and it cannot respond on this
          endpoint.

        The 200 response contains the following data:

        * `estimated_cost` - the estimated multi-dimensional cost of
          executing the Clarity VM on the provided transaction.
        * `estimated_cost_scalar` - a unitless integer that the Stacks
          node uses to compare how much of the block limit is consumed
          by different transactions. This value incorporates the
          estimated length of the transaction and the estimated
          execution cost of the transaction. The range of this integer
          may vary between different Stacks nodes. In order to compute
          an estimate of total fee amount for the transaction, this
          value is multiplied by the same Stacks node's estimated fee
          rate.
        * `cost_scalar_change_by_byte` - a float value that indicates how
          much the `estimated_cost_scalar` value would increase for every
          additional byte in the final transaction.
        * `estimations` - an array of estimated fee rates and total fees to
          pay in microSTX for the transaction. This array provides a range of
          estimates (default: 3) that may be used. Each element of the array
          contains the following fields:
            * `fee_rate` - the estimated value for the current fee
              rates in the network
            * `fee` - the estimated value for the total fee in
              microSTX that the given transaction should pay. These
              values are the result of computing:
              `fee_rate` x `estimated_cost_scalar`.
              If the estimated fees are less than the minimum relay
              fee `(1 ustx x estimated_len)`, then that minimum relay
              fee will be returned here instead.


        Note: If the final transaction's byte size is larger than
        supplied to `estimated_len`, then applications should increase
        this fee amount by:

          `fee_rate` x `cost_scalar_change_by_byte` x (`final_size` - `estimated_size`)
