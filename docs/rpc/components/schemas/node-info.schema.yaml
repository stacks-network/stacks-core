properties:
  peer_version:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Identifies the version number for the networking communication. This
      should not change while a node is running, and will only change if there's an
      upgrade.
  pox_consensus:
    type: string
    description: |
      A hash used to identify the burnchain view for a node. It incorporates
      bitcoin chain information and PoX information. Nodes that disagree on this value
      will appear to each other as forks. This value changes after every block.
  burn_block_height:
    type: integer
    description: Latest bitcoin chain height.
  stable_pox_consensus:
    type: string
    description: Same as pox_consensus, but evaluated at stable_burn_block_height.
  stable_burn_block_height:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The bitcoin block height at which the last PoX anchor block was seen.
      Leftover from stacks 1.0, basically always burn_block_height - 1.
  server_version:
    type: string
    description: A version descriptor for the node.
  network_id:
    type: integer
    description: Identifies the network (e.g., mainnet, testnet).
  parent_network_id:
    type: integer
    description: same as network_id, but for bitcoin
  stacks_tip_height:
    type: integer
    description: The latest Stacks chain height.
  stacks_tip:
    type: string
    description: The best known block hash for the Stacks chain.
  stacks_tip_consensus_hash:
    type: string
    description: The bitcoin consensus hash at the time that stacks_tip was mined.
  genesis_chainstate_hash:
    type: string
    description: The SHA256 hash of the genesis chainstate.
  unanchored_tip:
    type: [string, "null"]
    description: |
      The latest microblock hash if any microblocks were processed. If no
      microblock has been processed for the current block, a 000.., hex array is
      returned.
  unanchored_seq:
    type: [integer, "null"]
    description:
      The sequence number of the latest microblock if any microblocks were
      processed.
  tenure_height:
    type: integer
    description: The latest Stacks tenure height.
  exit_at_block_height:
    type: [integer, "null"]
    description: |
      The block height at which a testnet network will be reset.
      Not applicable to mainnet.
  is_fully_synced:
    type: boolean
    description: Indicates whether the node has fully synchronized with the network.
  node_public_key:
    type: [string, "null"]
    description: The node's public key.
  node_public_key_hash:
    type: [string, "null"]
    description: The HASH160 of the node's public key.
