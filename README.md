# Stacks Blockchain

Reference implementation of the [Stacks blockchain](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks) in Rust.

Stacks is a layer-2 blockchain that uses Bitcoin as a base layer for security and enables decentralized apps and predictable smart contracts using the [Clarity language](https://clarity-lang.org/). Stacks implements [Proof of Transfer (PoX)](https://community.stacks.org/pox) mining that anchors to Bitcoin security. Leader election happens at the Bitcoin blockchain and Stacks (STX) miners write new blocks on the separate Stacks blockchain. With PoX there is no need to modify Bitcoin to enable smart contracts and decentralized apps.

## Building

### 1. Download and install Rust

_For building on Windows, follow the rustup installer instructions at https://rustup.rs/._

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
```

- When building the [`master`](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-core/tree/master) branch, ensure you are using the latest stable release:

```bash
rustup update
```

### 2. Clone the source repository:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-core.git
cd stacks-core
```

### 3. Build the project

```bash
# Fully optimized release build
cargo build --release
# Faster but less optimized build. Necessary if < 16 GB RAM
cargo build --profile release-lite
```

_Note on building_: you may set `RUSTFLAGS` to build binaries for your native cpu:

```
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native"
```

or uncomment these lines in `./cargo/config.toml`:

```
# [build]
# rustflags = ["-Ctarget-cpu=native"]
```

## Testing

**Run the tests:**

```bash
cargo test testnet  -- --test-threads=1
```

**Run all unit tests in parallel using [nextest](https://nexte.st/):**

_Warning, this typically takes a few minutes_

```bash
cargo nextest run
```

_On Windows, many tests will fail, mainly due to parallelism. To mitigate the issue you may need to run the tests individually._

## Run the testnet

You can observe the state machine in action locally by running:

```bash
cargo run --bin stacks-node -- start --config ./sample/conf/testnet-follower-conf.toml
```

Additional testnet documentation is available [here](./docs/testnet.md) and [here](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/nodes-and-miners/miner-testnet)

## Release Process

The release process for the stacks blockchain is [defined here](./docs/release-process.md)
