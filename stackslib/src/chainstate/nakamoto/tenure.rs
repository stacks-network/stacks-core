//! This module is concerned with tracking all Nakamoto tenures.
//!
//! A _tenure_ is the sequence of blocks that a miner produces from a winning sortition.  A tenure
//! can last for the duration of one or more burnchain blocks, and may be extended by Stackers.  As
//! such, every tenure corresponds to exactly one cryptographic sortition with a winning miner.
//! The consensus hash of the winning miner's sortition serves as the _tenure ID_, and it is
//! guaranteed to be globally unique across all Stacks chain histories and burnchain histories.
//!
//! The tenures within one burnchain fork are well-ordered.  Each tenure has exactly one parent
//! tenure, such that the last block in the parent tenure is the parent of the first block in the
//! child tenure.  The first-ever Nakamoto tenure's parent block is the last epoch2 Stacks block.
//! Due to well-ordering, each burnchain fork has a highest tenure, which is used to validate
//! blocks before processing them.  Namely, a Nakamoto block must belong to the highest tenure in
//! order to be appended to the chain tip.
//!
//! Treating tenures as sequences of blocks mined by a winning miner allows us to cause coinbases
//! to mature based on tenure confirmations.  This is consistent with the epoch2 behavior.  It also
//! allows us to quickly identify whether or not a block belongs to a given tenure, and it allows a
//! booting miner to identify the set of all tenure IDs in a reward cycle using only burnchain
//! state (although some of these tenures may be empty).
//!
//! Tenures are created and extended via `TenureChange` transactions.  These come in two flavors:
//!
//! * A `BlockFound` tenure change, which is induced by a winning sortition.  This causes the new
//! miner to start producing blocks, and stops the current miner from producing more blocks.
//!
//! * An `Extended` tenure change, which is induced by Stackers. This resets the tenure's ongoing
//! execution budget, thereby allowing the miner to continue producing blocks.
//!
//! A tenure may be extended at any time by Stackers, and may span multiple Bitcoin blocks (such
//! as if there was no sortition winner, or the winning miner never comes online).
//!
//! `TenureChanges` contain three pointers to chainstate:
//! * The _tenure consensus hash_: this is the consensus hash of the sortition that chose the last
//! winning miner.  Note that due to the above, it may not be the highest sortition processed.
//! * The _previous tenure consensus hash_: this is the consensus hash of the sortition that chose
//! the miner who produced the parent tenure of the current ongoing tenure.
//! * The _sortition consensus hash: this is the tip of the sortition history that Stackers knew
//! about when they created the `TenureChange.
//!
//! The Nakamoto system uses this module to track the set of all tenures.  It does so within a
//! (derived-state) table called `nakamoto_tenure_events`.  Whenever a `TenureChange` transaction is
//! processed, a new row will be added to this table.
//!
