p2pkh or p2sh address.  It cannot be a native Segwit address, but it may be a p2wpkh-p2sh or p2wsh-p2sh address.

All of the parameters prefixed by `p` make up the `price function`. These parameters govern the pricing and lifetime of names in the namespace.

The rules for a namespace are as follows:
* a name can fall into one of 16 buckets, measured by length. Bucket 16 incorporates all names at least 16 characters long.
* the pricing structure applies a multiplicative penalty for having numeric characters, or punctuation characters.
* the price of a name in a bucket is `((coeff) * (base) ^ (bucket exponent)) / ((numeric discount multiplier) * (punctuation discount multiplier))`

* base = 10
* coeff = 2

* no-vowel discount: 10

When a name expires, it enters a \"grace period\". The period is set to 5000 blocks (a month) but can be configured for each namespace.
