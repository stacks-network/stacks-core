/// ## The Problem
///
/// There were two related design flaws in the way the Stacks blockchain deals with PoX anchor blocks:
///
/// * If it is ever the case in which a PoX anchor block is missing, and yet somehow manages to achieve 80% or more
/// confirmations during the prepare phase, then the subsequent arrival of that anchor block will cause a _deep_ chain
/// reorg.  It doesn't matter how many future blocks get mined -- if the anchor block is later revealed, it will
/// invalidate all of the blocks that did not build on it.  While mining and confirming an anchor block is very costly,
/// it's not only possible, but profitable: anyone who manages to do this could hold the blockchain for ransom by
/// threatening to disclose the anchor block and invaldiate all blocks after it unless they were paid not to (i.e. in
/// perpetuity).
///
/// * If it is ever the case that not enough STX get locked for PoX to begin in reward cycle _R_, then a node that
/// processes Stacks blocks first without the anchor block in _R_ and then with the anchor block in _R_ will crash
/// because it will attempt to calculate the same sortition twice.  This is because the same block-commits would be
/// processed in both cases -- they'd both be PoB commits.
///
/// This subsystem fixes both problems by making the _history of anchor blocks itself_ forkable, and by implementing
/// _Nakamoto consensus_ on the anchor block history forks so that there will always be a canonical anchor block
/// history.  In doing so, the Stacks blockchain now has _three_ levels of forks: the Bitcoin chain, the history of PoX
/// anchor blocks, and the history of Stacks blocks.  The canonical Stacks fork is the longest history of Stacks blocks
/// that passes through the canonical history of anchor blocks which resides on the canonical Bitcoin chain.
///
/// ## Background: Sortition Histories
///
/// Recall that each Bitcoin block can contain block-commits that are valid only if certain anchor blocks are known to
/// the node, and invalid if other anchor blocks are known.  Specifically, a block-commit can be a valid PoX
/// block-commit _only if_ the current reward cycle has an anchor block, _and_ that anchor block is known to the node.
/// Otherwise, if the block-commit does not descend from the anchor block, or there is no anchor block for this reward
/// cycle, then the block-commit can only be valid if it's a PoB block-commit.
///
/// What this means is that there is a _set_ of sortition histories on the Bitcoin chainstate that will each yield a
/// unique history of block-commits (which in turn represent a unique set of possible Stacks forks).  This set has
/// _O(2**n)_ members, where _n_ is the number of reward cycles that have anchor blocks.  This is because each time a
/// new reward cycle is processed with an anchor block, there will be a sortition history that descends from it in which
/// the anchor block is known to the node, and a sortition history in which it is _not_ known.
///
/// Which sortition history is the "true" sortition history, and how do we determine this?  This is what this subsystem
/// addresses.
///
/// ## Solution: Weight Sortition Histories by Miner Affirmations
///
/// Can we deduce whether or not an anchor block _should_ exist and be known to the network, using only Bitcoin
/// chainstate?  A likely anchor block's block-commit will have at least 80 confirmations in the prepare phase -- at
/// least F*w (i.e. 80) Bitcoin blocks will contain at least one block-commit that has the likely anchor block-commit as
/// an ancestor.
///
/// Of course, there are competing block-commits in each Bitcoin block; only one will be chosen as the Stacks block.
/// But, recall that in the prepare phase of a reward cycle, all miners must burn BTC.  Because miners are sending BTC
/// to the burn address, you can _compare_ the economic worth of all block-commits within a prepare-phase block.
/// Moreover, you can calculate how much BTC went into confirming a likely anchor block's block-commit.  In doing so, we
/// can introduce an extra criterion for selecting the anchor block in a reward cycle:
///
/// **The PoX anchor block for reward cycle _R_ is a Stacks block that has not yet been chosen to be an anchor block,
/// and is the highest block outside _R_'s prepare phase that has at least F*w confirmations and is confirmed by the
/// most BTC burnt.**
///
/// This is slightly different than the definition in SIP-007.  We're only looking at block-commits now.  If there are
/// two or more reward-phase block-commits that got F*w confirmations, then we select the block-commit that got the most
/// BTC.  If this block-commit doesn't actually correspond to a Stacks block, then there is no anchor block for the
/// reward cycle.  Also, if this block-commit has been an anchor block before in some prior reward cycle, then there is
/// no anchor block for this reward cycle.  If Stacks miners are honest, and no Stacks miner has more than 80% of the
/// mining power, then neither of these two cases arise -- Stacks miners will build Stacks blocks on top of blocks they
/// know about, and their corresponding block-commits in the prepare-phase will confirm the block-commit for an anchor
/// block the miners believe exists.
///
/// The key insight into understanding the solution to #1805 is to see that the act of choosing an anchor block is
/// _also_ the acts of doing the following two things:
///
/// * Picking a likely anchor block-commit is the act of _affirming_ that the anchor block is known to the network.  A
/// bootstrapping node does not know which Stacks blocks actually exist, since it needs to go and actually download
/// them.  But, it can examine only the Bitcoin chainstate and deduce the likely anchor block for each reward cycle.  If
/// a reward cycle has a likely anchor block-commit, then we say that the set of miners who mined that prepare-phase
/// have _affirmed_ to this node and all future bootstrapping nodes that they believed that this anchor block exists.  I
/// say "affirmed" because it's a weaker guarantee than "confirmed" -- the anchor block can still get lost after the
/// miners make their affirmations.
///
/// * Picking a likely anchor block-commit is the act of affirming all of the previous affirmations that this anchor
/// block represents.  An anchor block is a descendant of a history of prior anchor blocks, so miners affirming that it
/// exists by sending block-commits that confirm its block-commit is also the act of miners affirming that all of the
/// ancestor anchor blocks it confirms also exist.  For example, if there are 4 reward cycles, and cycles 1, 2, and 3
/// have anchor blocks, then the act of miners choosing an anchor block in reward cycle 4's prepare phase that descends
/// from the anchor block in reward cycle 3 is _also_ the act of affirming that the anchor block for reward cycle 3
/// exists.  If the anchor block for reward cycle 3 descends from the anchor block of reward cycle 1, but _not_ from the
/// anchor block in reward cycle 2, then the miners have also affirmed that the anchor block for reward cycle 1 exists.
/// Moreover, the anchor block in reward cycle 1 has been affirmed _twice_ -- both by the miners in reward cycle 3's
/// prepare phase, and the miners in reward cycle 4's prepare phase.  The anchor block in reward cycle 2 has _not_ been
/// affirmed.
///
/// The act of building anchor blocks on top of anchor blocks gives us a way to _weight_ the corresponding sortition
/// histories.  An anchor block gets "heavier" as the number of descendant anchor blocks increases, and as the number of
/// reward cycles without anchor blocks increases.  This is because in both cases, miners are _not_ working on an anchor
/// block history that would _invalidate_ this anchor block -- i.e. they are continuously affirming that this anchor
/// block exists.
///
/// We can define the weight of a sortition history as the weight of its heaviest anchor block.  If you want to produce
/// a sortition history that is heavier, but invalidates the last _N_ anchor blocks, you'll have to mine at least _N +
/// 1_ reward cycles.  This gets us a form of Nakamoto consensus for the status of anchor blocks -- the more affirmed an
/// anchor block is, the harder it is to get it unaffirmed.  By doing this, we address the first problem with PoX anchor
/// blocks: in order to hold the chain hostage, you have to _continuously_ mine reward cycles that confirm your missing
/// anchor block.
///
/// ## Implementation: Affirmation Maps
///
/// We track this information through a data structure called an **affirmation map**.  An affirmation map has the
/// following methods:
///
/// * `at(i)`: Determine the network's affirmation status of the anchor block for the _ith_ reward cycle, starting at
/// reward cycle 1 (reward cycle 0 has no anchor block, ever).  The domain of `i` is defined as the set of reward cycles
/// known to the node, excluding 0, and evaluates to one of the following:
///
///    * `p`: There is an anchor block, and it's present
///    * `a`: There is an anchor block, and it's absent
///    * `n`: There is no anchor block
///
/// * `weight()`:  This returns the maximum number of anchor blocks that descend from an anchor block this affirmation
/// map represents
///
/// Each block-commit represents an affirmation by the miner about the state of the anchor blocks that the
/// block-commit's Stacks block confirms.  When processing block-commits, the node will calculate the affirmation map
/// for each block-commit inductively as follows:
///
///    * If the block-commit is in the prepare phase for reward cycle _R_:
///
///         * If there is an anchor block for _R_:
///
///             * If this commit descends from the anchor block, then its affirmation map is the same as the anchor
///               block's, plus having `at(R)` set to `p`
///
///             * Otherwise, its affirmation map the same as the anchor block's, plus having `at(R)`set to `a`
///
///         * Otherwise:
///
///             * If the parent descended from some anchor block at reward cycle _R - k_ then this commit's affirmation
///               map is the same as its parent, plus having `at(R - k)` set to `p`, plus having all `at(R - k < x < R)`
///               set to `n` if reward cycle _x_ doesn't have an anchor block, and `a` if it does.
///
///             * Otherwise, this commit's affirmation map is defined as `at(x)` set to `n` if reward cycle _x_ doesn't
///               have an anchor block, and `a` if it does.
///
///    * Otherwise:
///
///         * If the parent descended from some anchor block in reward cycle _R - k_, then this commit's affirmation map
///           is the same as its parent, plus having `at(R - k < x < R)` set to `n` if reward cycle _x_ doesn't have an
///           anchor block, and `a` if it does.
///
///         * Otherwise, this commit's affirmation map is defined as `at(x)` set to `n` if reward cycle _x_ doesn't have
///           an anchor block, and `a` if it does.
///       
/// Consider the example above, where we have anchor block histories 1,3,4 and 1,2.
///
/// * A block-commit in the prepare-phase for reward cycle 4 that confirms the anchor block for reward cycle 4 would
/// have affirmation map `papp`, because it affirms that the anchor blocks for reward cycles 1, 3, and 4 exist.
///
/// * A block-commit in the prepare-phase for reward cycle 4 that does NOT confirm the anchor block for reward cycle 4, but
/// descends from a block that descends from the anchor block in reward cycle 3, would have the affirmation map `papa`,
/// because it does NOT affirm that the anchor block for reward cycle 4 exists, but it DOES affirm that the anchor block
/// history terminating at the anchor block for reward cycle 3 exists.
///
/// * A block-commit in the prepare-phase for reward cycle 4 that descends from a block that descends from the anchor block
/// for reward cycle 2 would have affirmation map `ppaa`, because it builds on the anchor block for reward cycle 2, but it
/// doesn't build on the anchor blocks for 3 and 4.
///
/// * Suppose reward cycle 5 rolls around, and no anchor block is chosen at all.  Then, a block in the reward
/// phase for reward cycle 5 that builds off the anchor block in reward cycle 4 would have affirmation map `pappn`.
/// Similarly, a block in reward cycle 5's reward phase that builds off of the anchor block in reward cycle 2 would have
/// affirmation map `ppaan`.
///
/// (Here's a small lemma:  if any affirmation map has `at(R) = n` for a given reward cycle `R`, then _all_ affirmation
/// maps will have `at(R) == n`).
///
/// Now that we have a way to measure affirmations on anchor blocks, we can use them to deduce a canonical sortition
/// history as simply the history that represents the affirmation map with the highest `weight()` value.  If there's a
/// tie, then we pick the affirmation map with the highest `i` such that `at(i) = p` (i.e. a later anchor block
/// affirmation is a stronger affirmation than an earlier one).  This is always a tie-breaker, because each
/// prepare-phase either affirms or does not affirm exactly one anchor block.
///
/// ### Using Affirmation Maps
///
/// Each time we finish processing a reward cycle, the burnchain processor identifies the anchor block's commit and
/// updates the affirmation maps for the prepare-phase block-commits in the burnchain DB (now that an anchor block
/// decision has been made).  As the DB receives subsequent reward-phase block-commits, their affirmation maps are
/// calculated using the above definition.
///
/// Each time the chains coordinator processes a burnchain block, it sees if its view of the heaviest affirmation map
/// has changed.  If so, it executes a PoX reorg like before -- it invalidates the sortitions back to the latest
/// sortition that is represented on the now-heaviest affirmation map.  Unlike before, it will _re-validate_ any
/// sortitions that it has processed in the past if a _prefix_ of the now-heaviest affirmation map has been the heaviest
/// affirmation map in the past.  This can arise if there are two competing sets of miners that are fighting over two
/// different sortition histories.  In this case, it also forgets the orphaned statuses of all invalidated and
/// re-validated Stacks blocks, so they can be downloaded and applied again to the Stacks chain state (note that a
/// Stacks block will be applied at most once in any case -- it's just that it can be an orphan on one sortition
/// history, but a valid and accepted block in another).
///
/// Because we take care to re-validate sortitions that have already been processed, we avoid the second design flaw in
/// the PoX anchor block handling -- a sortition will always be processed at most once.  This is further guaranteed by
/// making sure that the consensus hash for each sortition is calculated in part from the PoX bit vector that is
/// _induced_ by the heaviest affirmation map.  That is, the node's PoX ID is no longer calculated from the presence or
/// absence of anchor blocks, but instead calculated from the heaviest affirmation map as follows:
///
/// * If `at(i)` is `p` or `n`, then bit `i` is 1
/// * Otherwise, bit `i` is 0
///
/// In addition, when a late anchor block arrives and is processed by the chains coordinator, the heaviest affirmation
/// map is consulted to determine whether or not it _should_ be processed.  If it's _not_ affirmed, then it is ignored.
///
/// ## Failure Recovery
///
/// In the event that a hidden anchor block arises, this subsystem includes a way to _override_ the heaviest affirmation
/// map for a given reward cycle.  If an anchor block is missing, miners can _declare_ it missing by updating a row in
/// the burnchain DB that marks the anchor block as forever missing.  This prevents a "short" (but still devastating)
/// reorg whereby an anchor block is missing for _almost_ the duration of the reward cycle -- in such a case, the
/// absence of this declaration would cause the reward cycle's blocks to all be invalidated.  Adding this declaration,
/// and then mining an anchor block that does _not_ affirm the missing anchor block would solve this for future
/// bootstrapping nodes.
