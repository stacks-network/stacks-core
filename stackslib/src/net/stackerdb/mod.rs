/// # The StackerDB System
///
/// A StackerDB is a best-effort replicated database controlled by a smart contract, which Stacks
/// node operators can opt-in to hosting.  Unlike a smart contract's data space, a StackerDB's
/// data is not consensus-critical -- nodes do not need to read its state to validate the
/// blockchain.  Instead, developers use StackerDBSet to host and replicate auxiliary smart contract
/// data for the purposes of some (off-chain) application in a best-effort manner.  In doing so,
/// Stacks-powered applications are able to leverage the Stacks peer-to-peer node network to host
/// and disseminate their data without incuring the cost and performance penalties of bundling it
/// within a transaction.
///
/// ## Data Model
///
/// Data within a StackerDB is eventually-consistent.  In the absence of writes and network
/// partitions, all replicas will receive the latest data in a finite number of protocol rounds,
/// with high probability.  Given that network partitions in the peer-to-peer network are assumed
/// to be temporary, we assume that all StackerDB instances will receive the latest state in finite time.
/// Beyond this, it makes no guarantees about how quickly a write will materialize on a given replica.
///
/// The StackerDB schema is chunk-oriented.  Each StackerDB contains a fixed number of bound-size
/// _slots_, each of which contain one _chunk_.  Slots are array-indexed, and a slot may have zero
/// or one chunk.
///
/// A `write` to a StackerDB is the act of replacing one slot's chunk with new data, and a
/// `read` on a StackerDB is the act of loading one slot's chunk from the node's local replica.  Reading
/// and writing a single slot on one node is atomic.  StackerDB replication proceeds in a
/// store-and-forward manner -- newly-discovered chunks are stored to the node's local replica and
/// broadcast to a subset of neighbors who also replicate the given StackerDB.
///
/// Each slot has an associated Lamport clock, and an associated public key hash used to
/// authenticate writes.  The Lamport clock is used to identify the latest version of a slot's
/// chunk -- a node will replace an existing but stale copy of a chunk with a new chunk if its
/// Lamport clock has a strictly higher value.  The slot's metadata -- its ID, Lamport clock, and
/// data hash -- must be signed by the slot's public key hash's associated private key in order to
/// be stored.  The chunks themselves are ordered byte sequences with no mandatory internal
/// structure.
///
/// StackerDB state is ephemeral.  Chunk eviction is controlled by the smart contract.  At every
/// Bitcoin block, the node queries the smart contract for a list of slots to clear.
///
/// ## Control Plane
///
/// The smart contract to which a StackerDB is bound controls how many slots the DB has, who can
/// write to which slots (identified by public key hash), how big a slot is, and how often a
/// slot can be written to (in wall-clock time).  This smart contract is queried once per reward cycle
/// in order to configure the database.
///
/// Applications that employ StackerDBSet would deploy one or more smart contracts that list out
/// which users can store data to the StackerDB replica, and how much space they get.
///
/// ## Replication Protocol
///
/// StackerDB replication proceeds in a three-part protocol: discovery, inventory query, and
/// chunk exchange.  The discovery protocol leverages the Stacks node's neighbor-walk algorithm to
/// discover which StackerDBSet other nodes claim to replicate.  On receipt of a `Handshake` message,
/// a StackerDB-aware node replies with a `StackerDBHandshakeAccept` message which encodes both the
/// contents of a `HandshakeAccept` message as well as a list of local StackerDBSet (identified by
/// their smart contracts' addresses).  Upon receipt of a `StackerDBHandshakeAccept`, the node
/// stores the list of smart contracts in its `PeerDB` as part of the network frontier state.  In
/// doing so, nodes eventually learn of all of the StackerDBSet replicated by all other nodes.  To
/// bound the size of this state, the protocol mandates that a node can only replicate up to 256
/// StackerDBSet.  The handshake-handling code happens in net::chat::handle_handshake().
///
/// When a node begins to replicate a StackerDB, it first queries the `PeerDB` for the set of nodes
/// that claim to have copies.  This set, called the "DB neighbors", is distinct from the set
/// of neighbors the node uses to replicate blocks and transactions.  It then connects
/// to these nodes with a `Handshake` / `StackerDBHandshakeAccept` exchange (if the neighbor walk
/// has not done so already), and proceeds to query each DB's inventories by sending them
/// `StackerDBGetChunkInData` messages.
///
/// The DB inventory (`StackerDBChunkInvData`) is simply a vector of all of the remote peers' slots' versions.
/// Once the node has received all DB inventories from its neighbors, it schedules them for
/// download by prioritizing them by newest-first, and then by rarest-first, in order to ensure
/// that the latest, least-replicated data is downloaded first.
///
/// Once the node has computed its download schedule, it queries its DB neighbors for chunks with
/// the given versions (via `StackerDBGetChunkData`).  Upon receipt of a chunk, the node verifies the signature on the chunk's
/// metadata (via `SlotMetadata`), verifies that the chunk data hashes to the metadata's indicated data hash, and stores
/// the chunk (via `StackerDBSet` and `StackerDBTx`).  It will then select neighbors to which to broadcast this chunk, inferring from the
/// download schedule which DB neighbors have yet to process this particular version of the chunk.
///
/// ## Comparison to other Stacks storage
///
/// StackerDBSet differ from AtlasDBs in that data chunks are not authenticated by the blockchain,
/// but instead are authenticated by public key hashes made available from a smart contract.  As
/// such, a node can begin replicating a StackerDB whenever its operator wants -- it does not need
/// to re-synchronize blockchain state to get the list of chunk hashes.  Furthermore, StackerDB
/// state can be written to as fast as the smart contract permits -- there is no need to wait for a
/// corresponding transaction to confirm.
///
/// StackerDBSet differ from Gaia in that Stacks nodes are the principal means of storing data.  Any
/// reachable Stacks node can fulfill requests for chunks.  It is up to the StackerDB maintainer to
/// convince node operators to replicate StackerDBSet on their behalf.  In addition, StackerDB state
/// is ephemeral -- its longevity in the system depends on application endpoints re-replicating the
/// state periodically (whereas Gaia stores data for as long as the back-end storage provider's SLA
/// indicates).
