# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to the versioning scheme outlined in the [README.md](README.md).

## [3.1.0.0.7.0]

## Changed

- Add new reject codes to the signer response for better visibility into why a block was rejected.
- When allowing a reorg within the `reorg_attempts_activity_timeout_ms`, the signer will now watch the responses from other signers and if >30% of them reject this reorg attempt, then the signer will mark the miner as invalid, reject further attempts to reorg and allow the previous miner to extend their tenure.

### Fixed

- The signer runloop no longer relies on pubkey reports from the SignerDB event system. This previously led to improper proposal rejections via #5858.

## [3.1.0.0.6.0]

## Added

- Introduced the `reorg_attempts_activity_timeout_ms` configuration option for signers which is used to determine the length of time after the last block of a tenure is confirmed that an incoming miner's attempts to reorg it are considered valid miner activity.
- Add signer configuration option `tenure_idle_timeout_buffer_secs` to specify the number of seconds of buffer the signer will add to its tenure extend time that it sends to miners. The idea is to allow for some clock skew between the miner and signers, preventing the case where the miner attempts to tenure extend too early.

### Changed

- Increase default `block_proposal_timeout_ms` from 10 minutes to 4 hours. Until #5729 is implemented, there is no value in rejecting a late block from a miner, since a late block is better than no block at all.
- Signers no longer view any block proposal by a miner in their DB as indicative of valid miner activity.
- Various index improvements to the signer's database to improve performance.

## [3.1.0.0.5.0]

### Added

- Add `dry_run` configuration option to `stacks-signer` config toml. Dry run mode will
  run the signer binary as if it were a registered signer. Instead of broadcasting
  `StackerDB` messages, it logs `INFO` messages. Other interactions with the `stacks-node`
  behave normally (e.g., submitting validation requests, submitting finished blocks). A
  dry run signer will error out if the supplied key is actually a registered signer.
- Reduce default value of `block_proposal_timeout_ms` to 120_000

## [3.1.0.0.4.0]

### Added

- When a new block proposal is received while the signer is waiting for an existing proposal to be validated, the signer will wait until the existing block is done validating before submitting the new one for validating. ([#5453](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-core/pull/5453))
- Introduced two new prometheus metrics:
  - `stacks_signer_block_validation_latencies_histogram`: the validation_time_ms reported by the node when validating a block proposal
  - `stacks_signer_block_response_latencies_histogram`: the "end-to-end" time it takes for the signer to issue a block response

### Changed

## [3.1.0.0.3.0]

### Added

- Introduced the `block_proposal_max_age_secs` configuration option for signers, enabling them to automatically ignore block proposals that exceed the specified age in seconds.

### Changed
- Improvements to the stale signer cleanup logic: deletes the prior signer if it has no remaining unprocessed blocks in its database
- Signers now listen to new block events from the stacks node to determine whether a block has been successfully appended to the chain tip

## [3.1.0.0.2.1]

### Added

### Changed

- Prevent old reward cycle signers from processing block validation response messages that do not apply to blocks from their cycle.

### Added
