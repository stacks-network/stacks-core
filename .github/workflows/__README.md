ALL runnable workflows must be in the root of the .github/workflows folder. Subfolders are not allowed.

When adding or changing files, follow this file naming guidance:

- If the file is a "top level" workflow that will be triggered by an event such as a PR being opened or via CRON schedule, name it without any `_` prefix.
- If the file is a reusable workflow intended to be called by other workflows (and will include the `on: workflow_call:` trigger), prefix the filename with `_`.
