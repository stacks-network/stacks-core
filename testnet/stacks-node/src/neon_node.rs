/// When the node is running, there are 4-5 active threads at once.  They are:
///
/// * **RunLoop Thread**:  This is the main thread, whose code body lives in src/run_loop/neon.rs.
/// This thread is responsible for:
///    * Bootup
///    * Running the burnchain indexer
///    * Notifying the ChainsCoordinator thread when there are new burnchain blocks to process
///
/// * **Relayer Thread**:  This is the thread that stores and relays blocks and microblocks.  Both
/// it and the ChainsCoordinator thread are very I/O-heavy threads, and care has been taken to
/// ensure that neither one attempts to acquire a write-lock in the underlying databases.
/// Specifically, this thread directs the ChainsCoordinator thread when to process new Stacks
/// blocks, and it directs the miner thread (if running) to stop when either it or the
/// ChainsCoordinator thread needs to acquire the write-lock.
/// This thread is responsible for:
///    * Receiving new blocks and microblocks from the P2P thread via a shared channel
///    * (Sychronously) requesting the CoordinatorThread to process newly-stored Stacks blocks and
///    microblocks
///    * Building up the node's unconfirmed microblock stream state, and sharing it with the P2P
///    thread so it can answer queries about the unconfirmed microblock chain
///    * Pushing newly-discovered blocks and microblocks to the P2P thread for broadcast
///    * Registering the VRF public key for the miner
///    * Spawning the block and microblock miner threads, and stopping them if their continued
///    execution would inhibit block or microblock storage or processing.
///    * Submitting the burnchain operation to commit to a freshly-mined block
///
/// * **Miner thread**:  This is the thread that actually produces new blocks and microblocks.  It
/// is spawned only by the Relayer thread to carry out mining activity when the underlying
/// chainstate is not needed by either the Relayer or ChainsCoordinator threeads.
/// This thread does the following:
///    * Walk the mempool DB to build a new block or microblock
///    * Return the block or microblock to the Relayer thread
///
/// * **P2P Thread**:  This is the thread that communicates with the rest of the p2p network, and
/// handles RPC requests.  It is meant to do as little storage-write I/O as possible to avoid lock
/// contention with the Miner, Relayer, and ChainsCoordinator threads.  In particular, it forwards
/// data it receives from the p2p thread to the Relayer thread for I/O-bound processing.  At the
/// time of this writing, it still requires holding a write-lock to handle some RPC request, but
/// future work will remove this so that this thread's execution will not interfere with the
/// others.  This is the only thread that does socket I/O.
/// This thread runs the PeerNetwork state machines, which include the following:
///    * Learning the node's public IP address
///    * Discovering neighbor nodes
///    * Forwarding newly-discovered blocks, microblocks, and transactions from the Relayer thread to
///    other neighbors
///    * Synchronizing block and microblock inventory state with other neighbors
///    * Downloading blocks and microblocks, and passing them to the Relayer for storage and processing
///    * Downloading transaction attachments as their hashes are discovered during block processing
///    * Synchronizing the local mempool database with other neighbors
///    (notifications for new attachments come from a shared channel in the ChainsCoordinator thread)
///    * Handling HTTP requests
///
/// * **ChainsCoordinator Thread**:  This thread process sortitions and Stacks blocks and
/// microblocks, and handles PoX reorgs should they occur (this mainly happens in boot-up).  It,
/// like the Relayer thread, is a very I/O-heavy thread, and it will hold a write-lock on the
/// chainstate DBs while it works.  Its actions are controlled by a CoordinatorComms structure in
/// the Globals shared state, which the Relayer thread and RunLoop thread both drive (the former
/// drives Stacks blocks processing, the latter sortitions).
/// This thread is responsible for:
///    * Responding to requests from other threads to process sortitions
///    * Responding to requests from other threads to process Stacks blocks and microblocks
///    * Processing PoX chain reorgs, should they ever happen
///    * Detecting attachment creation events, and informing the P2P thread of them so it can go
///    and download them
///
/// In addition to the mempool and chainstate databases, these threads share access to a Globals
/// singleton that contains soft state shared between threads.  Mainly, the Globals struct is meant
/// to store inter-thread shared singleton communication media all in one convenient struct.  Each
/// thread has a handle to the struct's shared state handles.  Global state includes:
///    * The global flag as to whether or not the miner thread can be running
///    * The global shutdown flag that, when set, causes all threads to terminate
///    * Sender channel endpoints that can be shared between threads
///    * Metrics about the node's behavior (e.g. number of blocks processed, etc.)
///
